- InstallSnapshot Bugs

    1 Once a follower starts a snapshot install, need to set a global
      (and persistent) flag that prevents follower from becoming a candidate
      until the (or another) snapshot install completes, and during this time
      no new transactions may start because the log is unavailable.

    2 Should not erase existing log until new log is in place, otherwise
      we are violating the node's requirement for log persistence

- when negative AppendResponse rec'd, send next one immediately

- add new HermitRole to minimize disruption when node(s) get disconnected
    See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/raft-dev/5Lxxr2UwzQc/VmXlbo74lNwJ

- separate Loggers for:
    - transactions
    - messages (recv & xmit)
    - raft logic

- more memory-efficient Writes class

- fix issue where TCP connections are established in both directions ?

- apply more than one log entry at a time in a single atomic write if appropriate
